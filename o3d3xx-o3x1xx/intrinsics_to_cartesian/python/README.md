# Using Intrinsics and Unit Vectors

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the intrinsic calibration of the
camera to calculate the unit vectors.

It also demonstrates how to use the unit vectors (whether they were calculated
or obtained directly from the camera) to convert radial distance to cartesian
information in the camera coordinate frame.

The O3D303 camera model is based on the model described in this document:
