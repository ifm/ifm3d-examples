# Python Examples:
in this Branch you will learn how to work with `ifm3dpy` library. The script examples are divided depending on the use case:
1. **Core:** containing general scripts for O3R system
2. **ODS:** containing ODS example scripts

## Core:
In this directory you will find multiple scripts that will be explained in the following:

## 2d_data.py:
Receiving RGB data with ifm3d is done similarly as 3D data: the core objects have to be instantiated, and a frame has to be retrieved (see full code). 
The important part is how to access the RGB image and how to decode it for further use.
The decoded image can then be displayed, for instance with OpenCV.
