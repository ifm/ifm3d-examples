This directory contains example codes in `python3` and `c++` to help you start working with the O3R system. The available example codes are divided into three subdirectories:

1. **Core**
2. **ODS**
3. **Toolbox** (only `Python3` examples available atm)

## Core
The core examples, shows you how to use the `ifm3d` API to obtain image data (2D, 3D, distance image, etc.), configure camera parameters, update the embedded firmware, and more.
