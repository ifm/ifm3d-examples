# ifm3d Examples for OVP8xx

This directory contains example codes in `python` and `c++` to help you start working with the O3R system. The available example codes are divided into three subdirectories:

1. **Core**
2. **ODS**
3. **Toolbox** (only for the `python` examples)

## Core
In the core examples, you will learn how to use the `ifm3dpy` library to obtain image data (2D, 3D, distance image, etc.), configure parameters, update firmware, and more.

## ODS
In the ODS examples, you will find demonstrations of how to work with the Obstacle Detection System (ODS). This includes streaming data, analyzing the data, visualizing results, configuring the ODS, and using diagnostic scripts.

## Toolbox
Within the Toolbox, you will find helper scripts, including:
* Angle converter
* Extrinsic calibration
* H5 to ifm3d lib converter
* 2D-3D registration script
